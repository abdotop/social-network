   - [ ] Implement logic to retrieve followers and following users for a given user.

8. **Profile Management:**
   - [ ] Implement CRUD operations for user profiles.
   - [ ] Handle profile privacy settings (public/private).
   - [ ] Design and implement endpoints for profile information retrieval and updates.

9. **Posts:**
   - [ ] Design the structure for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting posts.
   - [ ] Implement endpoints for post creation, retrieval, and modification.
   - [ ] Handle privacy settings for posts (public/private).

10. **Groups:**
    - [ ] Design the logic for creating and managing groups.
    - [ ] Implement endpoints for group creation, invitation, acceptance, and removal.
    - [ ] Implement logic for users to join or leave groups.

11. **Chats:**
    - [ ] Design the chat system for private and group messaging.
    - [ ] Implement WebSocket functionality for real-time communication.
    - [ ] Handle message sending, receiving, and notifications.

12. **Notifications:**
    - [ ] Design the notification system for various events (e.g., follow requests, group invitations).
    - [ ] Implement logic to generate and send notifications to users.
    - [ ] Implement endpoints to retrieve and manage notifications.

13. **Testing:**
    - [ ] Write unit tests for each endpoint and functionality.
    - [ ] Perform integration tests to ensure different components work together.
    - [ ] Test error handling and edge cases thoroughly.

14. **Documentation:**
    - [ ] Document the API endpoints and their usage.
    - [ ] Provide setup instructions and guidelines for developers.
    - [ ] Document the database schema and migration process.

15. **Deployment:**
    - [ ] Prepare the backend application for deployment.
    - [ ] Choose a deployment platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS).
    - [ ] Configure environment variables and settings for production.
    - [ ] Deploy the backend application and ensure it's accessible.

16. **Monitoring and Maintenance:**
    - [ ] Set up logging and monitoring for the backend application.
    - [ ] Implement error tracking and reporting mechanisms.
    - [ ] Plan for regular maintenance tasks and updates.

17. **Security:**
    - [ ] Implement measures to prevent common security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
    - [ ] Regularly review and update security configurations.
    - [ ] Perform security audits and penetration testing periodically.

18. **Performance Optimization:**
    - [ ] Monitor and optimize database queries for performance.
    - [ ] Implement caching mechanisms where applicable.
    - [ ] Profile and optimize critical endpoints for speed and efficiency.

19. **Scalability:**
    - [ ] Design the backend application with scalability in mind.
    - [ ] Plan for horizontal scaling options as the user base grows.
    - [ ] Implement load testing to identify potential bottlenecks and areas for improvement.

20. **Continuous Improvement:**
    - [ ] Gather feedback from users and stakeholders to identify areas for improvement.
    - [ ] Iterate on features based on user feedback and analytics.
    - [ ] Regularly update dependencies and refactor code for maintainability.
